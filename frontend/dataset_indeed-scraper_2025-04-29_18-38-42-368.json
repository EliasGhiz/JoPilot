    "companyDescription": "Villanova University was founded in 1842 by the Order of Saint Augustine. To this day, Villanova’s Augustinian Catholic intellectual tradition is the cornerstone of an academic community in which students learn to think critically, act compassionately and succeed while serving others. Villanova prepares students to become ethical leaders who create positive change everywhere life takes them.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Villanova experience comes in part from the University’s welcoming community. All members are bonded together by a shared responsibility to uphold the ideals of Saint Augustine and let the principles of truth, unity and love guide their lives. The Villanova community helps students grow intellectually, professionally and spiritually, and challenges them to reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nThe University’s rigorous academic experience, rooted in the liberal arts, forms an environment in which students and professors are partners in learning. The Villanova community is dedicated to providing a personalized experience that fosters every student’s intellectual and spiritual well-being. As part of their education, students are encouraged to enrich their own lives by working for those in need. Through academic and service programs, students use their knowledge, skills and compassion to better the world around them.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 10,000 undergraduate, graduate and law students in the University’s six colleges—the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Villanova School of Business, the College of Engineering, the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing, the College of Professional Studies and the Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law. These colleges are the setting for an experience that develops both the heart and the mind, and creates the atmosphere where students are called to ignite change.\r\n\r\nVillanova University is located in a suburban community 12 miles west of Philadelphia, Pa.",

    "companyDescription": "PQ Corporation minds its Ps and Qs when producing industrial chemicals. It is one of the world's largest producers of sodium silicates (a glass product made from sand). Glass-bead products from its Potters Industries affiliate are used in highway striping to reflect headlights. PQ's glass beads are also used to grind and process pigments for paints, inks, and cosmetics. Its potassium silicates are used in welding rods, soaps, and detergents. PQ's magnesium sulfate is used in animal feed, packaging, and pharmaceuticals. Zeolytst International (a partnership with a  Royal Dutch Shell unit) makes zeolite-based catalysts and adsorbents for a range of chemical and petrochemical applications.\n\nPQ Corporation markets about 40 different silica-based chemical and performance product lines and operates about 60 chemical and manufacturing sites worldwide. \n\nThe company's PQ moniker dates back to Philadelphia Quartz, which began selling sodium silicate in 1861\n\nAfter more than a century and a half of family ownership, PQ Corporation has gone through several ownership changes in the latter half of this decade. It was owned by the founding Elkinton family until 2005, when the family sold the company to an affilite of JPMorgan Partners. JPMorgan then sold PQ to the Carlyle Group for $1.5 billion in 2007.\n\nNot long after Carlyle Group acquired the company, it merged PQ with former competitor Ineos Silicas, creating a billion-dollar behemoth that still retained the name PQ Corporation.\n\nIn 2011 the company was 60% owned by the Carlyle Group and 40%owned by British chemicals giant INEOS Group (40%). \n\nPQ Corporation traces its roots to a family soap and candle business opened by Joseph Elkinton in 1831 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

    "companyDescription": "Kindred's mission is to help our patients reach their highest potential for health and healing with intensive medical and rehabilitative care through a compassionate patient experience.\r\n\r\nIn December 2021, Kindred Healthcare was acquired by leading healthcare company, LifePoint Health. As part of this transaction, LifePoint and Kindred also launched a new company, ScionHealth. Today, Kindred’s facilities are now part of either LifePoint or ScionHealth. Specifically, Kindred’s 61 long-term acute care hospitals – along with 18 community-based, short-term acute care hospital campuses from LifePoint – are now a part of ScionHealth.\r\n\r\nAt Kindred, we’re dedicated to hope, healing and recovery. Our commitment to the highest quality care is at the heart of what we do every day. Our people deliver expert, supportive care solutions to patients, helping us shape the future of care for an aging America – a future where care is coordinated effectively across all types of settings, and where we can offer clarity and hope to those entrusted to our care.\r\n\r\nAs the country’s largest specialty hospital company, we care for people recovering from illness or injury. Whether they are receiving care in our hospitals or rehabilitation sites, our clinical care continues to exceed national benchmarks and earn us the respect of a top employer. With our diverse portfolio, we offer exciting careers throughout multiple settings. Find what best fits you!\r\n\r\nOur long-term acute care hospitals offer the same in-depth care offered in a traditional hospital or intensive care unit, but for an extended recovery period. With daily physician oversight, ICU/CCU-level staffing, and specially-trained interdisciplinary teams, we help our patients continue on their journey to wellness. You can bring recovery and healing to your community with our national footprint of more than 60 LTACHs.  \r\n\r\nBecause the patients in our Kindred Hospitals are frequently experiencing multiple illnesses, their stay with us is often measured in weeks rather than days. This allows our team members to get to know our patients and families. Further, clinicians working at a Kindred Hospitals typically get a broader experience than in other settings due to the smaller size of the hospitals and the higher acuity of our patients.\r\n\r\nVisit jobs.kindred.com for more information or to apply for a job today.",

    "companyDescription": "Friends Hospital is the oldest private psychiatric hospital in the nation. The hospital has been providing psychiatric treatment to adolescents, adults, and seniors for nearly 200 years. In 1813, the Quakers founded Friends Hospital based on the belief that all people, even those with a mental illness, can live a “moral, ordered existence if treated with kindness, dignity and respect.” The main focus of “moral treatment” was to strengthen the mental wellness of each patient. Thus, treatment concentrated on strengthening mental health, not on curing mental illness. This was a departure from the accepted view of the time and the guiding principle on which all of the hospital’s procedures were based.\r\n\r\nToday, Friends Hospital still operates under this original mission and, using the modern principles of wellness and recovery, strives to provide patients with the tools they need to understand and manage their illness. Starting with a thorough evaluation, a comprehensive treatment plan is developed to help stabilize acute psychiatric symptoms. This plan provides the foundation for an individualized aftercare plan that supports the patient’s return to the community. Helping patients gain and maintain a sense of balance and accomplishment is an important step on the pathway to wellness and recovery.\r\n\r\nStill a rural oasis in an urban setting, Friends Hospital continues as a mental health advocate for the community. The original “moral treatment” tenets of non-judgmental acceptance, individual responsibility, state of the art treatment modalities and gentle support remain its guiding principles.",
